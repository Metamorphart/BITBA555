The "lib" folder contains parts that are used in the simulation files. To install these parts, go to your "Documents/LTSpiceXVII" directory (or
wherever else LTSpice stores your projects), then copy the files into their associated directories under the "Documents/LTSpiceXVII/lib" directory.
The lib directory in this folder is laid out exactly like the one in your project directory so this should be straightforward.
